# Cluster Hardening (15%)

The "cluster hardening" section covers how to make a cluster as secure as possible after it's set up. In this chapter, I'll talk about ideas and practices that are usually managed by Kubernetes administrators. Whenever it makes sense, I'll include links to topics that the CKA exam has already covered.


- [x] Restricting access to the Kubernetes API

- [x] Configuring role-based access control (RBAC) to minimize exposure

- [x] Exercising caution in using service accounts

- [x] Updating Kubernetes frequently
