# Practice
Practice a lot with Kubernetes:

# CKS Exam Questions And Answers

# kubectl Ninja

Tip: Use [kubectl Cheatsheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/) during the exam. You don't need to decorate everything.

## Useful commands or parameters during the exam:

```bash
# Use "kubectl describe" for related events and troubleshooting
kubectl describe pods <podid>

# Use "kubectl explain" to check the structure of a resource object.
kubectl explain deployment --recursive

## Add "-o wide" in order to use wide output, which gives you more details.
kubectl get pods -o wide

## Check always all namespaces by including "--all-namespaces"
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

Generate a manifest template from imperative spec using the output option "-o yaml" and the parameter "--dry-run=client":

```shell
# create a service
kubectl create service clusterip my-service --tcp=8080 --dry-run=client -o yaml

# create a deployment
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml

# create a pod
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --restart=Never --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

Create resources using kubectl + stdin instead of creating them from manifest files. It helps a lot and saves time. You can use the output of the command above and modify as required:

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
...
EOF
```

It saves lots of time, believe me.

Kubectl Autocomplete

```shell
source <(kubectl completion bash)
```

## TIPS

* üí¨ Be fast
Use the history command to reuse already entered commands or use even faster history search through Ctrl r .

If a command takes some time to execute, like sometimes kubectl delete pod x. You can put a task in the background using Ctrl z and pull it back into foreground running command fg.

You can delete pods fast with:

``` bash
k delete pod x --grace-period 0 --force

k delete pod x $now # if export from above is configured
```

* üí¨ Vim

Be great with vim.

toggle vim line numbers

When in vim you can press Esc and type :set number or :set nonumber followed by Enter to toggle line numbers. This can be useful when finding syntax errors based on line - but can be bad when wanting to mark&copy by mouse. You can also just jump to a line number with Esc :22 + Enter.

copy&paste

Get used to copy/paste/cut with vim:

``` shell
Mark lines: Esc+V (then arrow keys)
Copy marked lines: y
Cut marked lines: d
Past lines: p or P
Indent multiple lines
```

To indent multiple lines press Esc and type :set shiftwidth=2. First mark multiple lines using Shift v and the up/down keys. Then to indent the marked lines press > or <. You can then press . to repeat the action.
