## Set the context and the namespace.
A "Context" is a combination of a cluster, user, and namespace. It is a way to specify the cluster you want to interact with, the user or authentication credentials you want to use, and the default namespace for that user. Setting a context is important because it helps you manage multiple Kubernetes clusters and switch between them easily.

**Use Cases:**  Multi-cluster Management, User and Authentication, isolate and organize resources, simplifies command-line operations.

**Hint:** Don't change the namespace, change the context as per the question. If there is a namespace add -n `namespace` to lessen the risk of error. Set context before each question using the kubectl config command, and switch between contexts using kubectl config use-context.
